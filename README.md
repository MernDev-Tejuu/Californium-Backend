* I cloned the repository using the "git clone" command, which fetched the code from the remote repository to my local machine.
* 
* I switched to the specific branch where I had pushed all the code from today's session using the "git checkout" command.

* I updated the code by using "git pull" to ensure I had the latest changes in my Visual Studio Code.
